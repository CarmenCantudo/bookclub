                    WHAT IF THE ONLY NORMAL THING IS TO BE DIFFERENT?<br>
                    After the success of Invisible and Tierra, Eloy Moreno returns to bookstores with one of the novels
                    most awaited by readers.<br>
                    More than 600,000 readers await the new novel by Eloy Moreno, one of the most widely read and loved
                    writers. Like his previous books, the new novel by Eloy Moreno vindicates and fights for important
                    values in our society, always through a plot full of enigmas and surprises.<br>
                    On this occasion, the author tells us about difference and normality, two concepts that, perhaps,
                    are not reflected as the reader expects.<br>
                    To find out more, we will have to read the novel...<br>
                    "For me a novel is like a gift, if they tell you what's inside it loses all flair. That's why I
                    never like to tell what my books are about, that's why I practically never put anything out about my
                    novels. The beauty of a story is that you get into it without knowing what you are going to find.
