            <p>This club wants to bring together book lovers of all interests and tastes in a virtual place where we can
                discuss our experiences with a literary work.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the pandemic, the idea came to escape for a while and travel, experience, imagine, and live
                through books and their limitless interpretative possibilities.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>The objectives of this club are:</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><h4>Recover the reading habit.</h4></li>
                <p>Reading is a somewhat solitary activity, and the fact that you can share it with someone else makes it
                    much more meaningful.</p>
                    <br>
                <li><h4>Make friends with similar interests.</h4></li>
                <p>Apart from discussing and commenting on the books, we also share them, schedule the reading of books on
                    all topics, and make video calls to discuss them. We also like talking about our lives and playing
                    online games.</p>
                    <br>
                <li><h4>Keep up with the latest ideas.</h4></li>
                <p>Being a book club member allows you to find books that you were unaware of, that you had never considered
                    reading, or that you simply haven't read because you were too lazy.</p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            
            <p>What book themes do we read? Fiction, Non-fiction, Classics, Fantasy, Self-helpâ€¦ We vote for everything!</p>
