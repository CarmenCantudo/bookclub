            <p>This club wants to bring together book lovers of all interests and tastes in a virtual place where we can
                discuss our experiences with a literary work.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the pandemic, the idea came to escape for a while and travel, experience, imagine, and live
                through books and their limitless interpretative possibilities.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The objectives of this club are:</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <h4>Recover the reading habit</h4>
                </li>
                <p>Reading is a somewhat solitary activity, and the fact that you can share it with someone else makes
                    it
                    much more meaningful.</p>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Make friends with similar interests</h4>
                </li>
                <p>Apart from discussing and commenting on the books, we also share them, schedule the reading of books
                    on
                    all topics, and make video calls to discuss them. We also like talking about our lives and playing
                    online games.</p>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Keep up with the latest ideas</h4>
                </li>
                <p>Being a book club member allows you to find books that you were unaware of, that you had never
                    considered
                    reading, or that you simply haven't read because you were too lazy.</p>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>What book themes do we read? Fiction, Non-fiction, Classics, Fantasy, Self-help… We vote for everything!

                    WHAT IF THE ONLY NORMAL THING IS TO BE DIFFERENT?<br>
                    After the success of Invisible and Tierra, Eloy Moreno returns to bookstores with one of the novels
                    most awaited by readers.<br>
                    More than 600,000 readers await the new novel by Eloy Moreno, one of the most widely read and loved
                    writers. Like his previous books, the new novel by Eloy Moreno vindicates and fights for important
                    values in our society, always through a plot full of enigmas and surprises.<br>
                    On this occasion, the author tells us about difference and normality, two concepts that, perhaps,
                    are not reflected as the reader expects.<br>
                    To find out more, we will have to read the novel...<br>
                    "For me a novel is like a gift, if they tell you what's inside it loses all flair. That's why I
                    never like to tell what my books are about, that's why I practically never put anything out about my
                    novels. The beauty of a story is that you get into it without knowing what you are going to find.
