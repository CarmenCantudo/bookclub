        <div id="intro-text">
            <p>The Tortoise and the Hare Book Club aims to bring lovers of books of all genres together in a virtual
                environment, where we can meet and discuss our literary experiences.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The idea was conceived during the pandemic to create a club where we can imagine, explore, and live
                through books with their limitless interpretative possibilities.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The objectives of this club are:</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <h4>Recapture the reading habit</h4>
                    <p>Reading is a somewhat solitary activity, and the fact that you can share it with someone else
                        makes
                        it much more meaningful and opens up the possibility of hearing an alternative interpretation.
                    </p><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Make friends with similar interests</h4>
                    <p>Apart from discussing and commenting on the books, we also share them, schedule the reading of
                        books on all topics, and make video calls to discuss them. We also like talking about our lives
                        and playing online games.</p><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Keep up with the latest ideas</h4>
                    <p>By being a book club member, you can find books that you were simply unaware of, maybe even a
                        book that you had never considered reading or just haven't read because you were too lazy.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>What book themes do we read? Fiction, Non-fiction, Classics, Fantasy, Self-helpâ€¦ We vote for everything!

                    One boy, one boat, one tiger... After the tragic sinking of a cargo ship, a solitary lifeboat
                    remains bobbing on the wild, blue Pacific. The only survivors from the wreck are a sixteen year-old
                    boy named Pi, a hyena, a zebra (with a broken leg), a female orang-utan -- and a 450-pound Royal
                    Bengal tiger. The scene is set for one of the most extraordinary and best-loved works of fiction in
                    recent years.

                <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> We all like to read, and we wanted to find a space where we could
                disconnect from our daily activities. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
            </p>
            <p class="review-right">
                <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> Although solitary reading is very beautiful, the fact that you have
                someone in front of you who has something to tell you about what you read enriches the experience a lot.
                What's more, now when I read for the club, I am much more active; I write and underline the books with
                more freedom because I spend all my time thinking about what I can share. <i
                    class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>

            <p class="review-left">
                <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> I think we have found more than a group of readers. Now we are friends
                and among the participants, we send each other new things to read through the WhatsApp group, including
                texts that some have written; but we've also ended up making time to have fun and talk. We had a great
                time. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
