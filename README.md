# Book Club

Book Club hopes to help people recover their reading habits, make new friends, and discover books they never thought they would like.
The site will be targeted toward readers that need a way to escape from the routine and are looking to socialise and learn new things.
Book Club will be useful for readers to see what book to read next and when they should be joining the next meeting to discuss about it.
