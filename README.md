# Book Club

Book Club hopes to help people recover their reading habits, make new friends, and discover books they never thought they would like.

The site will target readers who need a way to escape from the routine and are looking to socialise and learn new things.

Book Club will be helpful for readers to see what book to read next and when they should be joining the next meeting to discuss it.

+ Noto Sans: Light 300 for the body.
+ Special Elite: it mimics a typewriter and is used on the navigation menu.
+ Amiri: For book descriptions.

## Credits
### Content
The basic setup and aesthetic were based on the walk-through project "Love Running." I took the idea for the navigation bar design, the hero image and the display of social links in the footer section.

The form element's styling in "Love Running" served as a starting point for my form, which helped me recollect all of the aspects that needed to be addressed.
