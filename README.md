# Book Club

Book Club hopes to help people recover their reading habits, make new friends, and discover books they never thought they would like.

The site will be targeted toward readers that need a way to escape from the routine and are looking to socialise and learn new things.

Book Club will be useful for readers to see what book to read next and when they should be joining the next meeting to discuss about it.

## UX
### Site Purpose:
To provide information on the Book Club, including its book selection, meeting dates, and how to join.

### Site Goal:
To keep our existing book club members up to date on the books we are reading right now and the dates of our next meeting.

### Audience:
Everyone who enjoys reading and wants to recover their reading habits, meet new people, and discover new books.

### Communication:
The information is easily accessible to all visitors because of the website's straightforward design. Each page is labelled so that the user knows where they are always. Without having to conduct a thorough search, the information is readily available.

### Current User Goals:
To stay up to date on new meeting days and current readings.

### New User Goals:
- To be able to easily explore the site and comprehend the information offered.
- For the information to be current and relevant.
- To be motivated by a distinctive design that piques your interest right away and retains your attention on the site.


## Design
### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was designed with the goal of providing as much contrast as possible without becoming excessive. The accompanying imagery displayed across the site gives the majority of the colour.

![Colour palette](assets/images/color-palette.png)

### Typography
+ Playfair Display: Medium 500 Italic for quotes and regular 400 for titles.
+ Noto Sans: Light 300 for the body.
+ Special Elite: it mimics a typewriter and it’s used on the navigation menu.
+ Amiri: For book descriptions.

### Imagery
The site's imagery was gathered from free stock photo websites, and the sources are listed in the Credits section. Each photo provided supports the site's theme and reminds the user that this is a website about books and social meetings.

## Credits
### Content
The basic set-up and aesthetic were based on the walk-through project "Love Running." I took the idea for the navigation bar design and the display of social links in the footer section from there.

The form element's styling in "Love Running" served as a starting point for my form, which helped me recollect all of the elements that needed to be addressed.
